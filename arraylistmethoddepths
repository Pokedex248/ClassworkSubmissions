/**
 * Task 1: Print out the length of the foods ArrayList. 

Task 2: Inside of a print statement, add the String "Dole Whip" to foods. In the line comment 
for this code, state what it prints.

Task 3: Inside of a print statement, use the .set(E) method to change "Bread" in foods 
to "Butter". Comment what it prints. 

Task 4: Inside of a print statement, use the .remove(int) method to remove "Cookies"
 from foods. Comment what it prints.

Task 5: For each task, go back and comment what the method you are calling does, 
and what the method returns (both in general and in this case).
