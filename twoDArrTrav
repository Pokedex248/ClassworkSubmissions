/**
 * Task 1: Declare a 2D array of Strings with 7 rows and 6 columns. 

Task 2: One by one, print out the first element in each row, from top to bottom. 

Task 3: The code from Task 2 looks like it could be done using a loop. Use a loop to print out each row's first element. 

/******* When traversing 2D arrays down a column, it is called a "column-major order" traversal.  ********/

Task 4: One by one, print out each element in the first row only, from left to right. 

Task 5: Huh, that last task also looks like it could be done using a loop. Please use a loop to print out each element in the first row. 

/******* When traversing 2D arrays down a row, it is called a "row-major order" traversal.  ********/

Task 6: Copy your code from task 3 and paste it wherever you are doing this task. Edit it so it prints every element in each row, instead of just the first element. (Hint: first, make it print the first AND second elements of each row. Then make it print the first, second, AND the third element of each row. See a patern? If you turn this code into a loop, your nested loops will print out every element.)
